- **Title:** Exploring the Potential of LLMs as Radiology Report Evaluator 
- **Abstract:** The rise of large language models (LLMs) has opened new possibilities in medical AI, particularly in evaluating radiology reports. This study explores the potential of LLMs as radiology report evaluators. Current evaluation frameworks for radiology report generation are often shallow and limited, leading to inconclusive results about AI systems' capabilities. To address this, we propose a comprehensive pipeline for evaluating generated reports using LLMs, grounded in tasks such as label extraction and clarity scoring. Our experiments demonstrate that LLMs consistently outperform state-of-the-art (SOTA) labelers in labeling accuracy and show promise in clarity evaluation, particularly when leveraging agentic collaboration like majority voting. However, challenges remain, including mixed results with prompt engineering strategies, the limitations of multi-step prompting, and failure to fully align with radiologists' preferences for filtering more readable reports. This work represents a step forward in developing a robust, LLM-based evaluation framework, ultimately aimed at enhancing the quality and reliability of radiology report generation pipelines.

- **Instructor:** Chenhao Tan, Department of Computer Science  
- **Title:** Weak-to-Strong Generalization on Financial News Summarization
- **Abstract:** In this project, we investigate the applicability of the weak-to-strong generalization framework in the context of financial news summarization. We constructed a dataset of 2,000 financial news records and assessed the performance of OpenAI's framework from lexical and pragmatic viewpoints. Our findings indicate that: (1) the weak-to-strong generalization does not hold in the context of financial news summarization for the model classes tested; (2) while the summarization models like BART series more closely align with the ground truth compared to the text generation model LLaMA-1, they are less effective in producing financially informative summaries.
