<p align="center"><em>"Efforts, Partial and Unsatisfactory"</em> at Ryerson Floor 2, UChicago</p>

My economics professor in college once told me that UChicago is a sacred place for academic pursuit. Later, my first advisor at UChicago said he hoped that something of UChicago would stay with me. Looking back on my three-year journey—one year as an undergrad RA at Chicago Booth and two years of master's study—this has been an intensive but deeply rewarding experience. It transformed me from a traditional data-driven machine learning researcher into a more thoughtful and responsible AI practitioner.

At this turning point, I want to take a moment to reflect and summarize my experiences in this repository. Beyond formal publications, many projects here—though small or experimental—capture somekey “aha” moments throughout this journey.

Due to time constraints, I've mainly included structured outputs (e.g., reports, code, posters) related to AI topics. But I’ve also gained so much solid training in proof-based statistics during my first-year master study and hope to eventually convert my handwritten notes into LaTeX versions—though I still enjoy the charm of writing by hand! 🤡

- **Title:** Exploring the Potential of LLMs as Radiology Report Evaluator 
- **Abstract:** The rise of large language models (LLMs) has opened new possibilities in medical AI, particularly in evaluating radiology reports. This study explores the potential of LLMs as radiology report evaluators. Current evaluation frameworks for radiology report generation are often shallow and limited, leading to inconclusive results about AI systems' capabilities. To address this, we propose a comprehensive pipeline for evaluating generated reports using LLMs, grounded in tasks such as label extraction and clarity scoring. Our experiments demonstrate that LLMs consistently outperform state-of-the-art (SOTA) labelers in labeling accuracy and show promise in clarity evaluation, particularly when leveraging agentic collaboration like majority voting. However, challenges remain, including mixed results with prompt engineering strategies, the limitations of multi-step prompting, and failure to fully align with radiologists' preferences for filtering more readable reports. This work represents a step forward in developing a robust, LLM-based evaluation framework, ultimately aimed at enhancing the quality and reliability of radiology report generation pipelines.

- **Instructor:** Chenhao Tan, Department of Computer Science  
- **Title:** Weak-to-Strong Generalization on Financial News Summarization
- **Abstract:** In this project, we investigate the applicability of the weak-to-strong generalization framework in the context of financial news summarization. We constructed a dataset of 2,000 financial news records and assessed the performance of OpenAI's framework from lexical and pragmatic viewpoints. Our findings indicate that: (1) the weak-to-strong generalization does not hold in the context of financial news summarization for the model classes tested; (2) while the summarization models like BART series more closely align with the ground truth compared to the text generation model LLaMA-1, they are less effective in producing financially informative summaries.
- **Comment:** This is a toy project that we adapt OpenAI's weak-to-strong generalization framework into a financial news summarisation task.
